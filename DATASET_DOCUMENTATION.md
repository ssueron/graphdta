---

## 2. Affinity Value Encoding - CRITICAL INFORMATION

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Zero Values Have Different Meanings

#### **ChEMBL Dataset: pIC50 Values Only**
- **Data Source**: ChEMBL database (IC50 measurements converted to pIC50)
- **Value Range**: 3.3 - 12.0 (mean: 8.19)
- **Encoding**: `-log10(IC50 in M)` where IC50 is in molar units
  ```
  IC50 = 1 nM  → pIC50 = 9.0
  IC50 = 10 nM → pIC50 = 8.0
  IC50 = 1 μM  → pIC50 = 6.0
  ```
- **Zero Values**: ❌ **NO ZEROS** - all values are measured pIC50
- **Missing Data**: Not included in dataset (only tested pairs present)
- **Coverage**: 100% dense (every row has measured activity)

#### **PKIS2 Dataset: Sparse Selectivity Matrix**
- **Data Source**: PKIS2 kinome selectivity panel (DiscoverX KINOMEscan-style)
- **Value Range**: 0.0 - 9.0 (mean: 2.37)
- **Structure**: Each compound tested against ~299 kinases
- **Zero Values**: ✅ **REAL EXPERIMENTAL VALUES**
  ```
  0.0 = No activity detected (true negative)
  >0.0 = Measured pIC50 (active compound)
  ```
- **Coverage**: 42.3% sparse
  - **Non-zero values (55,060 / 130,065)**: Real measured activities
  - **Zero values (75,005 / 130,065)**: True experimental "no activity"
- **Distribution per compound**:
  ```
  Average tested kinases per compound: ~130 / 299
  Average zero activities: ~75 / 299 (true negatives)
  Average positive activities: ~55 / 299 (true actives)
  ```
- **Important**: PKIS2 has **100% coverage** - all compounds tested against all 298 kinases
  - No missing values (unlike sparse matrices with untested pairs)
  - Each compound has complete selectivity profile
  - Zeros represent real "no activity" experimental results

**Example PKIS2 Entry**:
```csv
compound_1,kinase_A,5.2  ← Active (pIC50 = 5.2)
compound_1,kinase_B,0.0  ← No activity (experimentally tested, inactive)
compound_1,kinase_C,7.1  ← Active (pIC50 = 7.1)
```

#### **Davis Dataset: pKd Values**
- **Data Source**: Davis et al. kinase dataset
- **Value Range**: 5.0 - 10.8 (mean: 5.51)
- **Encoding**: `-log10(Kd in M)` where Kd is dissociation constant
- **Zero Values**: ❌ **NO ZEROS** - all values are measured pKd
- **Coverage**: 100% dense

## 3. Model Handling of Different Value Types

### Current Model Behavior
The existing single-task models treat all affinity values uniformly:
```python
loss = MSELoss(prediction, target)  # Applied to all values equally
```

### ✅ **Models CAN Handle PKIS2 Sparse Data**
The architecture is **functionally compatible** with zeros:
- **Input**: Zero values are valid numerical inputs
- **Loss calculation**: MSE computed on all values including zeros
- **Training**: Model learns to predict low/zero values for inactive pairs
- **Issue**: Treats zeros as "very low activity" not "no activity"

### ⚠️ **Recommended Modifications for Selectivity**

Since PKIS2 zeros are **real experimental negatives** (not missing data), you have several options:

#### **Option 1: Keep Current MSE Loss (Simplest)**
Train on all values including zeros:
```python
loss = MSELoss(predictions, targets)  # Treats 0.0 as target value
```
**Pros**: No code changes, learns to predict inactive compounds
**Cons**: May over-penalize predictions near 0.0 (inactive region)
**When to use**: Quick baseline, want to predict both activity and inactivity

#### **Option 2: Weighted Loss (Better for Imbalanced Data)**
Give different weights to active vs inactive pairs:
```python
weights = torch.where(targets > 0.0, 1.0, 0.3)  # Lower weight for zeros
loss = (((predictions - targets) ** 2) * weights).mean()
```
**Pros**: Balances active/inactive learning, focuses on active compounds
**Cons**: Requires hyperparameter tuning (weight ratio)
**When to use**: PKIS2 training with imbalanced active/inactive ratios

#### **Option 3: Binary Classification + Regression (Best for Selectivity)**
Two-stage approach:
1. **Binary classifier**: Active (>0) vs Inactive (=0)
2. **Regressor**: Predict pIC50 for active compounds only
```python
# Stage 1: Is it active?
activity_logits = binary_head(features)
# Stage 2: If active, what's the pIC50?
affinity = regression_head(features)
```
**Pros**: Explicitly models selectivity (on/off-target), interpretable
**Cons**: Requires architecture modification
**When to use**: Production selectivity predictor, need binary classification

#### **Option 4: Robust Loss Functions**
Use loss functions less sensitive to outliers/zeros:
```python
# Huber loss (smooth L1)
loss = F.smooth_l1_loss(predictions, targets)

# Or log-cosh loss
loss = torch.log(torch.cosh(predictions - targets)).mean()
```
**Pros**: More robust to extreme values (very high activity or 0.0)
**Cons**: Less straightforward interpretation
**When to use**: Wide range of activities (0.0 to 12.0)

## 4. Protein Sequence Quality

### KLIFS Pocket Sequences
- **Standard Length**: 85 amino acids (KLIFS numbering system)
- **Vocabulary**: 20 standard amino acids + gap character ('-')
- **Encoding**: Integer mapping (A=1, C=2, ..., -=21, unknown=0)

### Sequence Length Distribution
```
Dataset              | 85aa  | 78aa  | 76aa | 80aa |
---------------------|-------|-------|------|------|
davis_klifs          | 99.3% | 0.7%  | -    | -    |
chembl_pretraining   | 99.7% | 0.3%  | <0.1%| <0.1%|
pkis2_finetuning     | 99.0% | 0.3%  | 0.3% | 0.3% |
```

### ⚠️ Davis 'X' Character Issue

**Finding**: 58 sequences in davis_klifs contain 'X' character (unknown amino acid)

**Origin**:
- Original Davis dataset uses 'X' for ambiguous residues from structure determination
- Kinase: **RIOK1** (RIO kinase 1) - atypical kinase family member
- Source: KLIFS pocket extraction from structural data with unresolved positions
- Position: Near C-terminus of pocket sequence
- Sequence: `GCISTGKEANVYHRAIKIYWAEKEMRNLIRLNIPCPEPIMLVLVMSFIGAPLLKNVQLSMYQDARLVHADLSEFNMLYIIXVSQS`
  - Two 'X' characters at positions 81-82 of 85aa pocket
- Also found in: **TESK1** (testis-specific kinase 1) with 2 X's

**Why 'X' instead of '-'?**
- KLIFS uses '-' for gaps in sequence alignment (missing positions)
- 'X' represents ambiguous amino acid identity (present but unknown)
- Difference: '-' = structural gap, 'X' = unresolved residue
- Davis dataset preserves this distinction from PDB structures

**Model Handling**:
```python
# Current behavior (create_data_unified.py:48)
seq_voc = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY-"
seq_dict = {v:(i+1) for i,v in enumerate(seq_voc)}
# X not in vocabulary
encoded = seq_dict.get('X', 0)  # X → 0 (unknown/padding token)

# In protein encoder (protein_cnn_simple.py:11)
self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_features_xt + 1, embed_dim)
# Creates 22 embeddings total:
#   Index 0: unknown/padding (for X, padding, etc.)
#   Index 1-21: standard amino acids (A-Y, -)
# X gets embedded via index 0 (learnable unknown token)
```

**Impact Analysis**:
- ✅ **Functional**: Model trains successfully with X → embedding learns representation
- ✅ **Rare**: Only 58/14,893 sequences (0.4%) affected in davis_klifs
- ⚠️ **Sub-optimal**: X treated as generic unknown, loses structural information
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent**: ChEMBL/PKIS2 use '-' for gaps, Davis uses 'X' for unknown

**Solutions (in order of recommendation)**:

1. **No Action (Recommended)**:
   - Current behavior is acceptable for 0.4% of data
   - Embedding learns to represent ambiguous positions
   - Minimal impact on overall performance
   - **Use when**: Davis is minor part of training data

2. **Replace X with '-'**:
   - Treat unknown residues as gaps
   - More consistent with ChEMBL/PKIS2 encoding
   - Simple preprocessing fix
   - **Use when**: Want consistent handling across datasets

3. **Add X to vocabulary**:
   - Create separate embedding for ambiguous residues
   - Preserves structural information distinction
   - Requires modifying encoding pipeline
   - **Use when**: Davis is primary dataset, need distinction

4. **Filter sequences**:
   - Remove RIOK1/TESK1 from training
   - Cleanest data but loses 58 samples
   - **Use when**: Strict quality control required

5. **Use full sequences**:
   - Bypass KLIFS, use complete protein sequences
   - No ambiguous residues in full sequences
   - Requires different alignment/padding strategy
   - **Use when**: Need complete structural context

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED (2025-10-14)** - All X characters replaced with '-' in davis_klifs_train.csv and davis_klifs_test.csv. Processed .pt files need regeneration (see [REGENERATE_DAVIS_PT_FILES.md](REGENERATE_DAVIS_PT_FILES.md)).

## 5. Data Quality Summary

### ✅ **Validated Quality Checks**

| Check | davis_klifs | chembl_pretraining | pkis2_finetuning |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Empty SMILES | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Invalid SMILES (RDKit) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Empty sequences | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Non-standard AA | 0 (fixed) | 0 | 0 |
| Affinity range | 5.0-10.8 | 3.3-12.0 | 0.0-9.0 |
| Sequence length consistency | 99.3% | 99.7% | 99.0% |
| Train/test kinase overlap | 100% | 100% | 100% |

### Train/Test Split Strategy
- **Type**: Compound-based split (kinases overlap 100% between splits)
- **Rationale**: Evaluate generalization to new compounds with known kinases
- **Implication**: Cannot predict for truly novel kinases without retraining
- **Appropriate for**: Kinase selectivity profiling of new compounds

### Cross-Dataset Kinase Compatibility
```
davis_klifs (211) ∩ chembl (298) = 165 kinases (78% overlap)
davis_klifs (211) ∩ pkis2 (298)  = 165 kinases (78% overlap)
chembl (298) ∩ pkis2 (298)       = 298 kinases (100% overlap!)
```

**Key Insight**: ChEMBL and PKIS2 share **identical 298 kinase sequences** → Perfect for transfer learning

## 6. Recommendations for Kinase Selectivity Task

### ✅ **Datasets Are Production-Ready**

**Recommended Training Strategy**:
```
Phase 1: Pretrain on ChEMBL (80K pairs, broad coverage, pIC50 only)
         Purpose: Learn general compound-kinase interactions
         ↓
Phase 2: Finetune on PKIS2 (130K pairs, selectivity format, includes zeros)
         Purpose: Specialize for selectivity patterns and inactive compounds
         ↓
Phase 3: Evaluate on PKIS2 test (31K pairs, selectivity metrics)
         Metrics: MSE, Pearson, Gini coefficient, selectivity entropy
```

**Why This Works**:
1. ChEMBL provides broad compound-kinase coverage (dense labels, diverse chemistry)
2. PKIS2 specializes in selectivity patterns (sparse matrix with true negatives)
3. Identical kinase sets (298 kinases) enable seamless transfer learning
4. Combined: 210K training pairs across 56K unique compounds
5. PKIS2's 100% coverage per compound provides complete selectivity profiles

### Architecture Modifications for Selectivity

**Current**: Single-task model predicting one affinity per forward pass
```python
output = model(drug_graph, protein_seq)  # Shape: [batch, 1]
```

**Proposed**: Multi-output model predicting all kinases simultaneously
```python
# Drug encoder (shared)
drug_emb = drug_branch(smiles)  # [batch, 128]

# Kinase encoder (reusable)
kinase_embs = protein_branch(kinase_seqs)  # [298, 128]

# Interaction prediction
combined = torch.cat([
    drug_emb.unsqueeze(1).expand(-1, 298, -1),  # [batch, 298, 128]
    kinase_embs.unsqueeze(0).expand(batch, -1, -1)  # [batch, 298, 128]
], dim=2)  # [batch, 298, 256]

affinities = interaction_head(combined)  # [batch, 298, 1]
```

**Benefits**:
- Single forward pass → all 298 kinase predictions
- True selectivity learning (model sees full profile)
- Can add kinase-kinase relationship modeling
- Efficient inference for selectivity profiling

### Selectivity-Specific Metrics

Standard DTA metrics (MSE, Pearson, CI) don't capture selectivity. Add:

1. **Gini Coefficient**: Measures selectivity concentration
   ```python
   gini = 1 - 2 * np.trapz(sorted_activities) / sum(activities)
   # Range: 0 (non-selective) to 1 (highly selective)
   ```

2. **Selectivity Entropy**: Information-theoretic selectivity
   ```python
   probs = activities / activities.sum()
   entropy = -np.sum(probs * np.log(probs))
   # Lower = more selective
   ```

3. **Selectivity Score (S10)**: Activity vs top-10 off-targets
   ```python
   S10 = activity_target / np.median(top10_offtargets)
   # Higher = more selective
   ```

4. **Kinase Family Selectivity**: Within-family vs cross-family
   ```python
   family_ratio = mean(same_family_activity) / mean(other_family_activity)
   ```
